# High_order_interdependent_ising

This code performe the simulations for the article "Realizing interdependent couplings as thermal or higher-order interactions" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08907).
The Monte Carlo simulations are written in c++ and used to find the bulk-melting and other transition thresholds.
The interdependent population dynamics code is written in python and used to solve numerically the replica-symmetric equations and evaluate the transition thresholds.
